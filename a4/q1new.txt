    Mutex/Sync Method

    Semaphore Method

    Barrier Method
        - 1.76u 0.04s 0:01.87r 30600kb ( 1 processor )
        - 1.75u 0.03s 0:01.77r 30600kb ( 2 processors )

    There are two caes with the performance difference, for Barrier method, if group size is constant,
    as locks increase performance decreaes. For example, with 130 voters and group size of 20, it had a
    real time of 2.56r while with 110 voters and same group size, it had a real time of 2.09r. On the other
    hand, as kernel threads increaes, performance increaes. For example, for above timing results, it increased
    by 0.1r.
