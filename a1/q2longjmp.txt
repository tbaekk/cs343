b)

    i)
    The output is not the same between the original and transformed program because the
    original program will call the destructor on struct T(s) that have been created when
    an exception occurs. On the other hand, the transformed program will not call the destructor.
    Thus, the output difference is that "~" will not be printed for the transformed program.

    ii)
    q2throwcatch: 12.97u
    longjmp     : 2.94u

    q2throwcatch: 15.31u (optimized)
    longjmp     : 2.78u (optimized)

    iii)
    longjmp: 10.03u smaller
        - It has the fastest performance because it does not have to handle throw/catch statements
        and throw/catch is expensive in runtime.

    iv)
    longjmp: 12.53u smaller
        - The original program became slower but transformed program became a little faster (same code
        but compiler optimized).
